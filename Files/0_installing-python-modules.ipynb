However, every time a cluster is spun up on AWS the installation of Python must be ported over from permanent storage, and the more it has to move and configure the longer the spinup process becomes.  Based on the assumption that most users will not need very many modules not already provided by pySpark, we have opted to minimize startup time by not pre-configuring Python with lots of modules.\n\n# Installing Modules\n\nThe current boostrap script installs `pip`, (module installation manager), `numpy` (many math operations), `requests` (tools for accessing the web) and `matplotlib` (graphing).  It also comes with the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/) that all installs have access to, such as `datetime`, `random`, `collections` and so on.
